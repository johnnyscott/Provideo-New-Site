Hi!

This is an example of how to use the Moogaloop Javascript API.

To change the video that's loaded, change the video_id variable.

mootools.html uses Mootools and Swiff. For more info, see the docs:
http://mootools.net/docs/core/Utilities/Swiff

swfobject.html uses just SWFObject without any libraries.

For more information on the Moogaloop API, see the doc page:

(Thanks to Casey for writing these examples!)
